# SO_Custom_Listview_Android

Have you ever needed to display a group of related items in a list?

Many times, right?

Suppose you have a chat app that allows users to find friends and chat with them. But, you’ll have to display the list of user’s friends in a list that let the user select which friend to connect with.
